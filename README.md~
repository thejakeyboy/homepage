# Damien Scieur's homepage

Welcome! You are free to use any piece of code present in this repo :-).

To make this website, I used
- [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), a static website generator (really, this is [awesomen](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Awesomen))
- [Bootstrap 4](https://v4-alpha.getbootstrap.com/), version alpha because *missing argument*.
- [This theme](https://github.com/pages-themes/hacker), a bit modified.
- [Jekyll-scholar](https://github.com/inukshuk/jekyll-scholar), for the references.
